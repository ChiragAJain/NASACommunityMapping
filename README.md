# Community Mapping  - Mapping predicted crops based on environmental dataset

The NASA International Space Apps Challenge is the largest global annual hackathon. This two-day event provides an opportunity for participants to utilize NASA's free and open data and its Space Agency Partners' space-based data to address real-world problems on Earth and in space

For this hackathon, we took up the challenge of "Community Mapping" and decided to go forward with mapping the predicted appropriate crops for the local region of Vijayawada, Amaravati and Guntur on the backdrop of the thematic map of the state of Andhra Pradesh, India.
